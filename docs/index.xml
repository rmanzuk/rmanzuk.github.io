      <description>&lt;p&gt;With a background as an academic geologist, I now investigate stories where we can better understand recent events by applying knowledge of the natural world. I combine Earth science expertise with data and image analysis to uncover patterns, detect shifts, and reveal how human activity intersects with environmental systems — and how those systems, in turn, can offer clues about what people are doing. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s using satellite imagery of vegetation to track land rights in conflict zones or tracing the illegal export of mining byproducts, I aim to tell data-rich stories that connect the technical to the urgent. I work especially well in collaboration with investigative journalists, grounding reporting in scientific evidence to strengthen stories built through source development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A High-Resolution Multispectral Camera for Geologists</title>

We risk cornering ourselves with a single tool that severely biases the work we do and the solutions we find—especially when that technology is trained mostly on data limited to what humans can already perceive. However, training automated agents to perform tasks also provides an opportunity to build technology that is genuinely complementary to humans, not just redundant but faster. The nice thing about computers is that we can feed them data from sources richer than our own senses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First, coral reefs take up far less than 1% of the ocean floor, yet an estimated 25% of marine species depend on them at some point in their life cycle. Second, reefs have been a near-constant presence in tropical seas ever since complex, shelly animals first appeared over 500 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
