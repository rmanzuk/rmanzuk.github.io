      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under construction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[link to paper]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[figure]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two facts about our planet that can spark a lot of curiosity and questions when thought about in tandem. [&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;] Reef environments, built by corals, take up a relatively small area on our seafloor today, but furnish a disproportionate amount of biodiversity in our oceans. An estimated 25% of marine species depend on a coral reef at some point in their life cycle, even though these environments take up far less than 1% of the ocean bottom when you look at a map. [&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;] Reefs have been a fairly-constant presence in tropical areas throughout Earth history ever since complex, shelly animals arose over 500 million years ago. Save few short-lived &amp;lsquo;reef gaps&amp;rsquo;, at least one group of animals (sometimes corals, sometimes others) has taken up the niche of reef-builder and created large mounds out of robust shells. Given their long, consistent history, have reefs always had this outsized impact on animal diversity, or is that phenomenon particular to coral reefs of today? Can large-scale shifts in Earth&amp;rsquo;s biosphere be explained by changes in reef ecosystems?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With a background as an academic geologist, I investigate stories where we can better understand recent events by applying knowledge of the natural world. I combine Earth science expertise with data and image analysis to uncover patterns, detect shifts, and reveal how human activity intersects with environmental systems â€” and how those systems, in turn, can offer clues about what people are doing. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s using satellite imagery of vegetation to track land rights in conflict zones or tracing the illegal export of mining byproducts, I aim to tell deeply reported, data-rich stories that connect the technical to the urgent. I work especially well in collaboration with investigative journalists, grounding reporting in scientific evidence to strengthen stories built through source development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
