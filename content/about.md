With a background as an academic geologist, I investigate stories where we can better understand recent events by applying knowledge of the natural world. I combine Earth science expertise with data and image analysis to uncover patterns, detect shifts, and reveal how human activity intersects with environmental systems â€” and how those systems, in turn, can offer clues about what people are doing. Whether it's using satellite imagery of vegetation to track land rights in conflict zones or tracing the illegal export of mining byproducts, I aim to tell deeply reported, data-rich stories that connect the technical to the urgent. I work especially well in collaboration with investigative journalists, grounding reporting in scientific evidence to strengthen stories built through source development.
