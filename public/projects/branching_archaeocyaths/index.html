There are two facts about our planet that can spark a lot of curiosity and questions when thought about in tandem. [1] Reef environments, built by corals, take up a relatively small area on our seafloor today, but furnish a disproportionate amount of biodiversity in our oceans. An estimated 25% of marine species depend on a coral reef at some point in their life cycle, even though these environments take up far less than 1% of the ocean bottom when you look at a map. [2] Reefs have been a fairly-constant presence in tropical areas throughout Earth history ever since complex, shelly animals arose over 500 million years ago. Save few short-lived ‘reef gaps’, at least one group of animals (sometimes corals, sometimes others) has taken up the niche of reef-builder and created large mounds out of robust shells. Given their long, consistent history, have reefs always had this outsized impact on animal diversity, or is that phenomenon particular to coral reefs of today? Can large-scale shifts in Earth’s biosphere be explained by changes in reef ecosystems?">
